
This pack contains:
 - patched GAME.CON,      fixing six "empty `*' branch" warnings
 - patched DEFAULT2.CON,  commenting definitions of missing (D3D) *.voc files
                          KICKHEAD.VOC -> KICKHIT.VOC

That should prevent unnecessary warnings in eduke32.log.

Putting these into a ZIP for the autoload folder should prevent them from
unintentionally overriding any other CONs or VOCs that come with Mods, TCs,
or user maps.
As long as it is seen first alphanumerically.
Therefore "1-no-nam-con-warnings.zip"

(See autoload.txt for more detailed information about the autoload system.)
