
This pack contains:
 - a patched Atomic GAME.CON, fixing two "`else' with no `if'" warnings
 - a patched Atomic USER.CON with two redundant sound definitions commented out
 - 14 dummy VOC files (one second of silence), defined in USER.CON
   but actually missing in DUKE3D.GRP

That should prevent unnecessary warnings in eduke32.log.

Putting these into a ZIP for the autoload folder should prevent them from
unintentionally overriding any other CONs or VOCs that come with Mods, TCs,
or user maps.
As long as it is seen first alphanumerically.
Therefore "1-no-atomic-con-warnings.zip"

(See autoload.txt for more detailed information about the autoload system.)
