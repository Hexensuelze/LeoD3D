                    =======================================


Copy mods, HRP, or Voxel Pack files into the ${HOME}/.eduke32/autoload folder 
and they will be loaded automatically without additional parameters. 
(Check the according option in the startup window, or add the line 
"NoAutoLoad = 0" to the [Setup] section of your eduke32.cfg file.)

Put only the currently required ZIPs into autoload. 

Packs which build upon other packs only need to have a file name "later" in the
alphanumerical sort order to override or add to other ZIP contents if necessary.

A common misconception is that the packages are actually "loaded" by EDuke32. 
Better consider their contents a bunch of sheets laid over each other with, 
say, zzz-mypack.zip on top. 
EDuke32 will only 'see' the lower priority files where (all) the layers above 
have a hole ( = file not present in their ZIP/GRP/folder). 


Priority from bottom to top:

 1. default  GRP (shipped with your game, usually DUKE3D.GRP, fury.grp, etc.)
 2. -gamegrp GRP/ZIP
 3. autoload GRPs
 4. autoload ZIPs
 5. -g GRPs/ZIPs   in parameter order
 6. -j [dir] files in parameter order
 7. files in the current working directory


Many mods, especially the bigger ones like DukePlus, are not meant to be put 
into autoload in the first place, but some may still be able to use it the 
other way round. Always consult their accompanying documentation first.

Because some shitty operating system(s) won't differ between upper/lower case 
letters, which affects the sort order, it is recommended to use 
lower case letters only for filenames in autoload.

I recommend to not have plain game files in your autoload folder,
only ZIP or GRP packages.

Do NOT set autoload as "Custom game content directory" in the startup window,
that's very bad practice. The same goes for "-j autoload". 

Do NOT name a folder containing game files "DUKE3D.GRP". That's even worse IMO.

The -noautoload command line option will temporarily override the current 
setting without altering the configuration file. 

In order to turn a game contents folder into an autoload package, zip up what's
in it, NOT the folder itself.


The behaviour of other Duke Nukem 3D ports (BuildGDX, Raze, etc.) and even 
other games based on EDuke32 (NBlood, VoidSW, etc.) may differ from EDuke32, 
concerning either autoload, command line parameters, or both.


What I know about DukeGDX (BuildGDX):

 AFAIK BuildGDX doesn't take any command line parameters.

 Phredreeke added:
  For DukeGDX, ZIP files in the autoload folder are actually loaded separate 
  and isolated from each other (a DEF file in a ZIP file can not define an 
  image found in another ZIP file).

 This means that you couldn't use the Z-Pack on top of the HRP, for example.
 (The current DukeGDX v1.15 (BuildGdx v20.081) can't deal with many of the
  HRPs DEF parameters anyway.)

 From BuildGDX' 1.15 readme.txt:
  Autoload folder can be used to load mods at game startup. These can include 
  custom music packs, voxels, maphacks, HRP etc. 
     ***You are not supposed to put custom campaigns into autoload folder*** 
  BGDX will automatically load all zipped files in the autoload folder and 
  execute the following .def files:
   - unpacked .def files
   - .def files inside .zip archives that have the name of the port 
      (dukegdx.def, bloodgdx.def, swgdx.def, rrgdx.def, psgdx.def, 
       twgdx.def, lspgdx.def, or whgdx.def)
