Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniv. World Tour - Stopgap Compatibility Layer for EDuke32
Release 20200329 -> e32wt_20200329.zip


This pack contains:

 - 14 dummy VOC files (one second of silence), defined in E32WT_CODE.CON
   but actually missing in DUKE3D.GRP
 - 14 dummy OGG files (one second of silence), defined in USER.CON
   but actually missing in World Tour's sound\ folder
 - a patched World Tour FLAMETHROWER.CON, fixing one
   "empty `ifcount' branch" warning
 - a patched World Tour USER.CON with one redundant sound definition commented
   out and all OGG file definitions with upper case basename, UNIX path names
 - a patched World Tour GAME.CON, fixing two "`else' with no `if'" warnings
                         and loading the patched CONs above
 - a patched E32WT_CODE.CON, loading the patched GAME.CON
 - a patched E32WT.CON,      loading the patched E32WT_CODE.CON
 - An EDUKE.CON file to override World Tour's GAME.CON and load the patched
   CONs instead



That should prevent unnecessary warnings in eduke32.log.

 Putting these into a ZIP for the autoload folder should prevent them from
unintentionally overriding any other CONs or OGGs that come with Mods, TCs,
or user maps. As long as it is seen first alphanumerically.
Therefore "1-e32wt_20200329no-con-warnings.zip"

Do not extract e32wt_20200329.zip, drop it into autoload,too. Or, you could
extract both instead of using autoload, but that's ugly.

If you have another EDUKE.CON, your manual intervention will be required.

(See autoload.txt for more detailed information about the autoload system.)
